Some of the most impactful developments in AI recently have come from modeling and generating *sequences*.
In this lesson we'll start learning about how we can extend the sort of modeling we've been doing to them.

Students who complete this unit will demonstrate that they can:

- Describe language modeling as a prediction problem
- Describe how perplexity relates to log-likelihood and cross-entropy (and the general concept of partial credit in classifiers)
- Implement basic data manipulation operations in language processing

## Preparation

Since NLP has advanced so much in the past few years, we're starting to hit the limits of the fastai material.

- MIT IDL Lec 2
- [SLP3](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) (architectures, tasks, RNN etc.)

- *Skim* {{<fastbook num="10" nbname="10_nlp.ipynb">}}
  - Some of this material is relevant, some of it isn't.
  - {{<fastvideo num="8">}} discusses this material. Watching it is decidedly optional.
