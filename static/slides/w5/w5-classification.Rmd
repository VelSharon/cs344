## Logistics

- Reflection and Homework due tomorrow

---

## Interesting Points from Discussion?

- Share with neighbors.
- Then we'll share with everyone.

---

## How to classify?

- How do we measure how good a classifier is?
- How do we turn scores into probabilities?

---

## Elo

A measure of relative skill:

- Higher Elo more likely to win
- Greater point spread -> more confidence in win

- Uses: [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system), [NFL](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-the-nfl/)
- 538's [Superbowl prediction](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nfl-predictions/games/) 
([discussion](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rams-or-bengals-our-guide-to-super-bowl-lvi/))

## How do we measure how good a classifier is?

Cross Entropy: should give high probability to correct result.

---

## How do we turn scores into probabilities?

---

## Where do the "right" scores come from?

- In linear regression we were given the right scores.
- In classification, we have to learn the scores from data.

## Review

Which of the following is a good *loss function* for classification?

1. Mean squared error
2. Accuracy (number of answers that were correct)
3. Error rate (number of answers that were incorrect)
4. Average of the probability the classifier assigned to the wrong answer
5. Average of the negative of the log of the probability the classifier assigned to the right answer

Why?

## Softmax

This year the Super Bowl is between the LA Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals.

FiveThirtyEight rates their team Elo scores at 1661 for the Rams and 1593 for the Bengals.
